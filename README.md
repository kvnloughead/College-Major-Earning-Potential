# Expected Earnings by College Major
### A DataQuest guided project

What follows is practice study of data collected regarding job outcomes of students from a variety of majors who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.  The data orginally comes from a US census [survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), but it was further cleaned by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).  They have an article about the data somewhere on the interwebs which I'm sure is much better than this notebook.
